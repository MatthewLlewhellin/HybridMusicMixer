=====================================
Hybrid Mixer Application Deliverables
=====================================
This repository contain the code for my 
final year project during my BSc Computer Science

The project is to create a music mixer application,
similar to that a DJ would use. The application is
noted as "hybrid" as there are future implementations
planned to enable the user to futher manipulate the
sound and tracks.

The current application runs as an .exe file, but future
development will transfer this project into a .vst, which
will enable the features previously described to be
implemented.

The code is produced in C++ but uses JUCE,
to run the code the ProJucer must be installed.
"https://juce.com/discover/projucer".

GitHub has issues uploading the ProJucer project currently.
To run the project you will have to create a new ProJucer
project and copy the source code manually.

Be sure to create the project as an .exe and to implement
the modules shown in Module_list.png.
